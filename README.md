# simongalver-appletube
This is a straight copy and paste of Simon Galver's Apple Tube userstyle theme.


# Why does this exist?
Basically, userstyles.org has became so terrible that I've decided it's no longer worth it to deal with that trash site.
And looking around I couldn't find any references to the creator of this theme (Simon Galver) at all, aside from a dead Facebook fanpage and an inactive Twitter account.

# What does this theme do?
It changes Youtube up with some Apple-esque touch.

# When was this last updated?
November 3rd, 2020 as of writing this README.
